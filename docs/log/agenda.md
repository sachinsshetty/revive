* How you set up an API using a framework like Spring Boot
* How you do persistence, perhaps even into a postgres database
* How you use automated unit & integration tests to proof the functionality
* Whether you have a CI/CD pipeline, preferably using Github Actions
* A minimalistic frontend app / UI is a clear bonus
* An automated deployment into your favorite cloud would be awesome, but really a stretch
* How you present all of this, including problems, challenges, tricks etc.
